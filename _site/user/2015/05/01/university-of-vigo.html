Campus Do Mar LogoMain Project goals were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Test Opencast as a Campus Wide media recording and publishing solution, specifically:
– As an Automatic Lecture Capture solution
– As a Manual Conference Recording solution
– As a Videoconference Recording solution</li>
  <li>Test the integration of Opencast with Campus services and legacy media portal</li>
  <li>Get feedback from professors and students before launching a larger deployment</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This Opencast based project was carried by University of Vigo (UVigo) as part of the “Campus do Mar” initiative.</p>

<h2 id="about-uvigo-and-campus-do-mar">About UVigo and Campus do Mar</h2>
<p><strong>University of Vigo</strong> is a young, public University (20.000 students) located in the Galicia region (Northwest of Spain).</p>

<p><strong>Campus do Mar</strong> is a project spearheaded by the University of Vigo and promoted by the three Galician universities, the Spanish Council of Scientific Research (CSIC) and the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). It therefore brings together socio-economic agents and marine researchers from the Galicia-Northern Portugal Euro-region, in order to harness the best possible potential and optimize the available resources.</p>

<p>It sets out to energize a cross-border network comprised of research, teaching and technology transfer units, with a view to training the best professionals and researchers in the field of Marine Science and thus generating quality research with international impact. The involvement of several key industrial partners in the Board of Advisors also empowers Campus do Mar to be a reliable asset of the local industry for the global scale competition.</p>

<h2 id="departments-involved-number-of-people">Departments involved, number of people</h2>
<p>The IT department of University of Vigo was in charge of the project. The company TELTEK Video Research was contracted to design and carry out the project.</p>

<h2 id="project-startend-date">Project Start/End Date</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project Start: January 1st 2012</li>
  <li>Project End: December 31th 2012</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scale-of-project">Scale of Project</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.opencast.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CampusDoMar1.jpg" />
During the first stage of this pilot project we have put into use on the main campus of the university:Instructor viewing the lecture capture device</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 medium size classrooms</li>
  <li>2 videoconference rooms</li>
  <li>2 mobile recording units</li>
</ul>

<p>With the fixed equipped rooms we have recorded and published 20 courses, with a total of 345 lessons or 395 hours of lectures. More than 32,000 downloads were registered on those resources (Feb 2013), an interesting number considering that only 90 of those lectures were openly published to the world, the rest being password protected.</p>

<p>With the mobile Galicaster units we have recorded 19 meetings and conferences, with a total of 584 videos or 218 hour of recorded presentations, roundtables, etc… By February 2013, there have been more than 63,000 downloads. Almost 100% of these recordings are open. (the downloading figures include only the direct Opencast downloads, not the Youtube or iTunes U downloads).</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-external-systems">Integration with external systems</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.opencast.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CampusDoMar2.jpg" />
The platform built for this pilot project is, in fact, an integration of Opencast with Galicaster and PuMuKIT, another two open tools:</p>

<p>galicaster screen Galicaster is an Opencast-compatible capture agent. It has been developed by Teltek Video Research following the needs and goals of the agents for the Opencast deployment, namely: Graphical User Interface (touchscreen-oriented); live visual feedback of what is being recorded, including a red “recording light” and a vu-meter for audio monitoring; remote monitoring of the recording, via VNC; basic, in-place control of the recording (start, pause, stop buttons); a Media Manager for finished recordings (browse, play and delete) and full compatibility with the Opencast scheduling system. (www.galicaster.org)</p>

<p>PuMuKIT is a comprehensive media cataloguing system, developed at the University of Vigo since 2004 and now adopted by some other Universities. It provides an elegant and customizable front-end, as well as enhanced capabilities for cataloguing videos and publishing them automatically in Youtube or iTunes-U. PuMuKIT has allowed the University of Vigo to reunite their legacy media content with the new multistream content generated by Opencast, in a single, good-looking, institutional media portal. (www.pumukit.org)</p>

<p>In the last stage of the project, the Paella HTML5 Engage-Player was also deployed. That was done using PuMuKIT to provide a “Smart” player that switches the underlying technology depending on the user browser capabilities: the HTML5 player as default, with a fallback to the standard Flash engage player or to a “monostream” version of the recordings for Android or iOS devices (a composition of the 2 streams, side by side, in one frame).</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-choose-opencast">Why did you choose Opencast?</h2>
<p>opencast engage player with multistreamWe have been working on open-source projects for quite a long time. It is an environment where we feel comfortable. For that reason, the University of Vigo entered the Opencast project from the beginning, and it has been our permanent goal to have a real Opencast-based production system in place.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning the big and friendly Opencast community, where you can always find advice and support.</p>

<p>One of the key features for adopting Opencast was its well designed architecture and modularity.</p>

<p>Being an open-source and modular platform really simplifies our work adapting other tools to the platform and the platform to those tools. In fact, due to our specific needs, a new Opencast-compatible capture agent (Galicaster) was developed for this project, and we have also supported the development of the Paella HTML5 Engage Player by UPV (Polytechnic University of Valencia).</p>

<p>We have also been able to successfully integrate Opencast with PuMuKIT, our legacy, home-grown, open-source media content manager, and finally build up a system that integrates the Captured Lectures into several distribution channels that were already being used before the adoption of Opencast: Youtube, iTunes-U, Moodle and the University’s institutional Media Portals (tv.campusdomar.es and tv.uvigo.es).

<h2 id="how-does-your-work-provide-potential-benefit-for-the-opencast-community">How does your work provide potential benefit for the Opencast community?</h2>
<p>We think that the Campus do Mar Opencast pilot can be a good showcase of the use of Opencast as a Lecture Capture System in the real world today, with 20 courses (close to 400 hours) and very good feedback from the professors and students involved.</p>

<p>The recordings were centralized on just a few classrooms to stress the recording and ingesting systems, thus providing a feedback on the pain points of Opencast when it comes to scaling the system to bigger deployments.</p>

<p>This pilot, with 19 meetings recorded (more than 200 hours) using Opencast, can also add its bit to demonstrate how Opencast can be used as a Campus wide solution for media production, not only in lectures, but also in sporadic events such as congresses and conferences.</p>

<p>Several talks were held at different University IT-staff meetings in Spain and South America, to present the outcomes of the pilot but also the Opencast community and project. Those activities led to a growing interest of several Spanish-speaking Universities about Opencast.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning the creation of the Opencast Spanish-speaking community, fostered by the University of Vigo, which tries to help other universities in Spain and Latin America to join the Opencast community and deploy their Opencast installations.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>During the last months of 2012 we started the deployment of 8 new Galicaster-equipped classrooms and 1 more mobile recording unit. Besides, our legacy recording Mini-Studio (used mainly for MOOC-like video recording) was migrated to a Opencast-compatible solution during the same period.</p>

<p>We have also set up a remote recording system. It is based on a Galicaster unit attached to a H323-H239 videoconference unit. This setup is now able to connect to any videoconference or meeting room and record it remotely. Both presenter and presentation videos are recorded in High Definition.</p>

<p>We consider “University of Vigo/Campus do Mar” Opencast-system in real production since January 1st 2013.</p>

<p>Regarding development efforts we are very interested on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Opencast core stability and scalability</li>
  <li>Self recording/publishing solutions</li>
  <li>HTML5 engage player</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contributions-to-opencast">Contributions to Opencast</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple Bugfixes</li>
  <li>Several tasks done towards enabling the OCR service with multilingual support.</li>
  <li>Foster development (through TELTEK Video Research) of tools and systems needed to fulfill the goals of this project but also valuable for others trying to improve the Opencast experience: (released as open software)
– Galicaster Capture Agent,
– Opencast-PuMuKIT integration.
– Executor Service. (A new service that allows the Opencast operators to run any command with Mediapackages and their elements as arguments.)
– Opencast-Moodle (still in progress).
– Capture Agent Monitoring tool (still in progress).</li>
</ul>
